## 1. Research question

Labor shortage is currently significant challenge in global agriculture, while both land use and labor is affecting agricultural food supply. In this report, we aim to analyze the trend of agricultural land use and labor from 1961 to 2019 in 16 key agricultural countries, investigating the relationship between labor issues in agriculture and land use to understand their interdependencies and effects on global agriculture.


## 2. Data set introduction

The dataset comprises agricultural land use, labor and food supply from 1961 to 2019 for 16 major agricultural production countries, providing insights into global agricultural trends and practices.The data sets with 944 observations and 6 variables were extracted from Our World in Data [https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/agricultural-labor-land]. It is an open-source database and can be used for research and analysis purposes. 

The extracted dataset has variables from countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, UK, USA from 1961 to 2019. There are three numerical variables-- agricultural land use for the sum of croplands and permanent pastures for livestock grazing, agricultural labor for the number of people in agriculture, which includes hiredlabor and unpaid family labor, and agricultural food supply for the total output of agricultural products.

## 3. Data set description


```{r}
#Import the dataset.
data <- read.csv("agricultural_labor_land.csv")

data1 <- data.frame(data)

```

The dataset contains `r ncol(data1)` variables and `r nrow(data1)` observations.
The figure of the code is showing as the following.

```{r, echo= TRUE, out.width='100%', out.height='100%'}
# Display the screenshot of code
knitr::include_graphics("Image/Screenshot.png")

# Create a table with variable names for data1
variable_names <- data.frame(Variable = names(data1))

kable(variable_names, caption = "Variable Names of dataset")

str(head(data1, 2))
```


## 4. Data Summary

```{r}
# Select 2 numerial variables and one character, calculate two summary statistics
summary_stats <- data1 %>%
  select(Entity, Year, ag_land_index,labor_index) %>%
  group_by(Entity) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_land_use = mean(ag_land_index, na.rm = TRUE),
    variance_land_use = var(ag_land_index, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_labor = mean(labor_index, na.rm = TRUE),
    variance_labor = var(labor_index, na.rm = TRUE),
  )

kable(head(summary_stats, 10))


```

From this data summary, it can be observed that **Germany** and France have the highest mean labor values, suggesting a significant workforce in agriculture, with Germany also exhibiting the highest variance in labor, indicating large fluctuations or diversity in agricultural labor over the observed period. Additionally, New Zealand stands out with a notably high mean land use and the greatest variance in land use, which could imply extensive and varied agricultural practices in terms of land utilization.

## 5. Visualisations


```{r figure-plot, fig.cap="Figure 1: Total Land Use vs. Total Labor of Main Agricultural Countries from 1961 to 2019"}

# Create one figure related with research question.
long_data <- data1 %>%
  gather(key = "Type", value = "Value", ag_land_index, labor_index)

aggregated_data <- long_data %>%
  group_by(Year, Type) %>%
  summarise(Total = sum(Value, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot_object <- ggplot(aggregated_data, aes(x = Year, y = Total, color = Type)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(aggregated_data$Year), max(aggregated_data$Year), by = 5)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
        legend.position = "bottom") + 
  labs(title = "Total Land Use vs. Total Labor of Main Agricultural Countries",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Total Value")

# Convert to an interactive plot
interactive_plot <- ggplotly(ggplot_object)

# Display the plot

```

- *The graph depicts a significant decrease in labor, suggesting a reduction in the agricultural workforce over the observed period.Conversely, land use shows a gradual increase until 1990, after which it experiences slight fluctuations and a marginal decline.*
- *The graph illustrates a diverging relationship between agricultural land use and labor: while land use experienced a slow increase until 1990 followed by slight fluctuations and a minor decrease, labor in agriculture showed a marked and consistent decline over the same period.*


```{r figure-plot2, fig.cap="Figure 2: Agricutural Labor over 16 countries from 1961 to 2019"}

# Add additional figure and table
# Agricultural Labor over 16 countries from 1961 to 2019
p <- ggplot(data1, aes(x = Year, y = labor_index, color = Entity)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot for agricultural labor over 16 countries", 
       x = "Year", 
       y = "Labor")

# Convert to a plotly interactive object
p_interactive <- ggplotly(p, tooltip = c("x", "color"))

# Show the interactive plot
p_interactive

```



```{r}
# Use table to describe the data
# Summarize data by entity
summarized_data <- data1 %>%
  group_by(Entity) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_labor = mean(labor_index, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_land_use = mean(ag_land_index, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_food_supply = mean(food_supply_per_capita, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# Create a table with kable
kable(summarized_data, caption = "Labor, Land Use, and Food Supply by Entity")
```

- *As shown in figure 2 and above table, reveals significant variations in agricultural labor, land use, and food supply across different countries. Figure 2 indicates a marked decline in agricultural labor in Germany, France, and South Korea, whereas Russia, the UK, the US, Canada, and South Africa experienced a more gradual decrease. In contrast, China and India saw labor increases until 2006 before a subsequent decline, and Mexico showed a consistent rise over time.*
- *The above table provides a detailed agricultural labor index, shows Germany with the highest average labor, suggesting a substantial agricultural workforce, while Mexico records the lowest. This disparity could be attributed to different agricultural practices and mechanization levels in these countries. In terms of land use, New Zealand leads with the highest average, indicative of extensive agricultural activity, whereas Brazil's lower average land use might reflect its specific agricultural practices and land availability. This diverse agricultural dynamics across countries might be shaped by a myriad of factors including geographical and climatic conditions, technological advancements, and economic policies in the agricultural sector.*


## 6. Conclusions

The analysis of agricultural data for major agricultural countries reveals significant trends in land use and labor. The data shows a steady increase in land use until 1990, followed by a period of fluctuation and a slight decrease, alongside a consistent decline in labor. This suggests a shift towards more efficient, mechanized farming, driven by technological, economic, and policy changes. The substantial labor decrease, despite varying land use trends, indicates a workforce restructuring, potentially due to urban migration and demographic shifts. 

Moreover, country-specific data reveals diverse agricultural dynamics. While Germany, France, and South Korea experience significant labor declines, countries like Russia, UK, and US show gradual decreases. In contrast, labor in China and India initially increased before declining, and Mexico shows a consistent rise. These variations suggest differing agricultural practices and levels of mechanization, reflecting a complex agricultural landscape shaped by a multitude of global and local factors.
